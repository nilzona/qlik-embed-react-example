## Recommended Editor

At Qlik we recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the editor for your frontend projects.
It is a free editor and lightweight out of the box with excellent support for all popular programming languages due to
an extensive extension model. [Jetbrains Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) is a very capable alternative. It
does however require a license.

## Qlik recommended vscode extensions

We consider some extensions more important than others. In the end it is your preference of how you choose to use the
available tooling, but these are the recommendations.

### Must haves

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - Runs the eslint tool continously
  in your project and gives you real time feedback when eslint rules are not followed.

- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Formats your code so that the
  code style is consistent throughout the project.
